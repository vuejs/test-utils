# vue-test-utils-next

The next iteration of Vue Test Utils.

Docs are located in [this repo](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-next-docs). That's because running Vuepress alongside a repo with Vue 3 causes conflicts - Vuepress expects to be running against Vue 2. This seems like the most simple solution during development.

## Development

It's a pretty small codebase at the moment. Get started by running `yarn install`. You can run the tests with `yarn test`. That's it!

Lots to do. Most of the ideas and roadmap is in Notion. See issues for some basic TODOs.

## Working with `.vue` files

There is [`vue-jest`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-jest) for loading `.vue` files into Jest. The `next` branch contains support for Vue 3. It is not on NPM yet, but we use it here.

## Contributing

This is still very much pre-beta - if you want to add a feature, have a hack or ping someone in Discord to chat, or check out the issues and project board.
